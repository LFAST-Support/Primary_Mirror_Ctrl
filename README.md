# Primary_Mirror_Ctrl
The primary mirror control system consists of 3 mirror support actuators, and 3 home switches.  The 3 motors are used to change the tip, tilt, and focus of the primary mirror.  There is also a fan controller that controls the fans that blow on the back of the mirror to dissipate heat from the TECs.  The Teensy 4.1 microcontroller is used to receive commands from the host computer, translate them into stepper motor commands, and step the motors to achieve the commanded positions.  The controller will then remember the current position of each of the motors, to allow the system to rapidly recover after a power outage or ungraceful shutdown.  The communications with the host computer are over the Ethernet.
